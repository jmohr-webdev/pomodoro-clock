<h3>WHAT IS A POMODORO CLOCK?</h3>

The pomodoro technique is a productivity hack developed by Francesco Cirillo, named for the tomato-shaped timer he used.

Pick a task you want to focus on for a set period of time (typically 25 minutes) and then take a short break (typically 5 minutes).

You may use the interval controls to set the lengths of your session and break intervals. Godspeed!
